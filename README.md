# WifiLocationLogger

Logs current location and signal strength of visible wireless networks. (Log location: `/sdcard/WifiLocationLogger`.)

This application is *experimental* â€“ do not expect it to work well, or at all. Tested with Android 5.0.2.

Feel free to open an Issue for bug reports or feedback of any kind.
Pull requests very welcome.

## To-Do

- [ ] collect real-world data on a variety of devices and see whether it's usable at all
- [ ] make the app work while in the background (current behavior unknown)
- [ ] visualize data points on map [wishlist]
